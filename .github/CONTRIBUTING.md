# üöß Notice üöß

Pardon the mess. The `master` branch is in flux while we work on javastips v1. This
means things like npm scripts, which we encourage using for contributions, may
not be working. Thank you for your patience.

## Coding Guidelines

In addition to the following guidelines, please follow the conventions already
established in the code.

- **Spacing**:<br>
  Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs.

- **Naming**:<br>
  Keep variable & method names concise & descriptive.<br>
  Variable names `index`, `array`, & `iterate` are preferable to
  `i`, `arr`, & `fn`.

- **Quotes**:<br>
  Single-quoted strings are preferred to double-quoted strings; however,
  please use a double-quoted string if the value contains a single-quote
  character to avoid unnecessary escaping.

- **Comments**:<br>
  Please use single-line comments to annotate significant additions, &
  [JSDoc-style](http://www.2ality.com/2011/08/jsdoc-intro.html) comments for
  functions.

Guidelines are enforced using [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint):
```bash
  $ npm run style
```

## Tips

You can opt-in to a pre-push git hook by adding an `.opt-in` file to the root of
the project containing:
```txt
pre-push
```

With that, when you `git push`, the pre-push git hook will trigger and execute
`npm run validate`.
